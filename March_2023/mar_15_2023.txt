Current Projects: Personal Website - AWS Certification - NLP Project

It has been a really long time since I last made a blog post. 3 months, today actually. Since last I wrote, a lot has happened. I started my semester abroad in Amsterdam where I am taking a Text Mining for AI class where I am learning about various NLP techniques in python and am about to start a final project around sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and topic classficiation. 

I also made a ton of progress on my blog website and I think I'm going to put it up on the shelf for a while. I discovered firebase which allowed me to easily set up a backend database for user authentification and to store the posts of a user as well as a load of other cosmetic changes and features all visible on this github.

In 3 weeks, I start my computer networks class which has inspired me to check out Amazon AWS. I'm taking the basic AWS user course at the moment, but might branch out into other certifications later. I have also started working on my personal website again. The site looks like a business card that the user can flip to learn more about me. I want it to function as a more fun resume than the standard flat, one-page pdf sheet and, so far, it's looking really good.
