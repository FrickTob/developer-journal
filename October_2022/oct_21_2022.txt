Current Projects: Chess Vision - CompSci Shiny App - Personal Website

Today is the start of my software developer journal. This is not, however, the start of my software developer journal.
I think it's best to try to record everything I have done along my dev journey so far. I started in Spring 2021 learning
to code in Racket and C. Fall 2021 I learned Java and it became my favorite coding language. I learned how to make GUIs
and even created a poker app for android that calculates poker statistics for beginner poker players. That repository is
here if you want to check it out. Everything I'm going to be working on will be here on this github account for that matter.

Currently, I am taking a computer vision course where I am learning MatLab. I'm learning a lot and am going to work with my
classmate Will on a project that uses computer vision techniques to identify chess pieces and positions given an image of a
chess board. I am also taking a Software Design and Development class where I will be making an R shiny web app to provide a
hub for information about the Computer Science major at Grinnell College (where I go to school). These will be my first
experiences with collaborative programming, so I'm excited to learn more about that and use github to help.

In my free time, I am starting to learn HTML and CSS so that I can begin working on a personal website. I want this to be a
space that can grow and adapt as I do (much like this journal).

Next Summer I'll be an software dev intern at Epic Systems up in Madison, WI. Not sure exactly what I'll be doing, but really
excited nonetheless.

Until Tomorrow,
Toby
