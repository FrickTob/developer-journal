Current Projects: Chess Vision - CompSci Shiny App - Personal Website - Poker Android App

It's been a while since I wrote a journal entry, so here's a summary of what has been going
on since last I journaled. We have begun work in my Software Design and Development class
on our group projects. The project I am assigned to is an app that provides career development
resources for Computer Science students. Grinnell's CS departments doesn't have a large
emphasis on industry, so this app is an attempt to bridge that gap and inform students
on internships, research opportunities, alumni resources, and coding interview prep advice.

We have also begun work on the Chess Vision project. Specifically, we have just finished
correctly implementing a function that calculates the planar homography between an image of
a chess board and a 'top down' view of a chess board. This homography calculation gives us
a matrix which can convert points in a 'top down' view of a chess baord into the corresponding
points in an image of a chess board. This technique can be used to identify and label baord squares
in any image of a chess board. From there, we will crop out each square and try to identify the piece
on that square using a convolutional nerual network.

Work on my personal website and android app has been put on the back burner for the time being.
I hope to start these projects back up again after this semester is over and I have more time
in January.
