Current Projects: Chess Vision - CompSci Shiny App - Personal Website - Poker Android App

Looked back over the Poker Android App I built and deployed last summer and started to
brainstorm ways to make the user input more intuitive. What I came up with is having a
dropdown menu of all 52 cards to select from. Additionally, I can have an image that
updates depending on the user input. The implementation was surprisingly easy and needed
me to make a hash map with keys that matched a dropdown list option and values that match
the corresponding image of a card. I also updated the button so that it calculates based
on this new input. Still need to work on making the layout responsive to horizontal orientation
and different screen sizes. Feeling more confident about my ability ot implement designs I think
up and looking forward to working on it more.

Until Tomorrow,
