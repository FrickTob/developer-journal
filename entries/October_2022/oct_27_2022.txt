Current Projects: Chess Vision - CompSci Shiny App - Personal Website - Poker Android App

Today I worked on a Computer Vision assignment about inferring depth by stereo reconstruction.
My partner and I got stuck for a very long time fiddling with little things until I realized we
were using the wrong output from one of the functions we called that returned two different matrices.
The rest of the lab followed quickly after that. This weekend, I want to work a little more
on updating the UI in my Poker App.

Until Tomorrow,
Toby
