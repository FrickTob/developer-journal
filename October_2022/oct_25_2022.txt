Current Projects: Chess Vision - CompSci Shiny App - Personal Website - Poker Android App

Didn't do a lot of work today on personal projects as it was a very busy day. However,
I did write some MatLab code today in my Computer Vision class. We are working on
creating structure from stereo vision. Depth is calculated by similar triangles
and recording the displacement between matching features between two images.
I'm really enjoying working with these computer vision concepts even though
the math can get a little to complex for me to fully understand.

Until Tomorrow,
Toby
