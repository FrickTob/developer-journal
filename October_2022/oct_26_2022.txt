Current Projects: Chess Vision - CompSci Shiny App - Personal Website - Poker Android App

Didn't write any code today, but I did some research into the Chess Vision project.
Specifically, I read about hough transforms which can be used to detect lines in
an edge detection image. I can use this hough transform to identify the chess grid and
locate each square.

Until Tomorrow,
Toby
