Current Projects: Chess Vision - CompSci Shiny App - Personal Website

Today I continued working on my personal website and decided to restart.
I am finding that the hardest part for me is having the initial design
that I would like to implement. I have the urge to start coding right
away and it's leading me to dead-ends. I don't need to finish this
website for a while because I already have everything planned out until
next august, so I'm going to put it on the back burner for now and
keep taking not of designs I like from the internet.

Until Tomorrow,
Toby
