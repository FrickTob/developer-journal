Current Projects: Chess Vision - CompSci Shiny App - Personal Website

Not much to report today. I worked a little more on my website. I think
I have a really nice start using pure HTML/CSS and need to start learning
javascript to really bring it to the next level. Classes start tomorrow,
so the other two projects I'm working on are going to move to the main
burner.

Until Tomorrow,
Toby
