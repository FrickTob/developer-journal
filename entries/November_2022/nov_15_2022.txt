Current Projects: Chess Vision - CompSci Shiny App - Personal Website - Poker Android App

Today I learned about image segmentation techniques used to cluster segments of an image
into categories. We also implemented a k-means clustering algorithm where we take an image
and cluster the pixels into k different categories based on their RGB value similarities.

I'm going to start doing some more Chess Vision work in the next few days on square extraction
and a new technique my project partner Will is learning about where instead of using a CNN to
identify individual pieces, we measure the height of the pieces and use their relative heights
to identify the pieces.
