Current Projects: Calendar System at Epic

It's been a long time since I've made a journal entry. Between now and my last entry, I've flown back to the US and started my internship at Epic. I'm really enjoying the work I'm doing and being given a lot of positive feedback from experienced developers. It's been very validating and confirmed my decision to pursue a career in CS. It is however taking up a lot of my time whihc is why it's been 3 months since my last entry!

I have three more weeks of this internship and then I'm headed back to Grinnell for Senior year. I have two more CS classes to complete my major, Automata and Analysis of Algorithms. I'm taking one each semester which will hopefullt give me time to work on updating my resume, website and start applying for real jobs in the outside world. My girlfriend is applying for law school to start fall 2024, so ideally my job will be in the city she is studying in or flexible enough to allow me to travel often.

Feeling really good about the CS aspects of my life and excited to see where I wind up next!
